# sms-loan

Predict which consumers will default after taking an SMS loan

## Problem statement

The data comes from a company with a banking license that gives out credit to individuals. The objective is to use the data to fit the best possible model and predict the binary target.

## Method

* Select X variables
* Create a pipeline containing with:
  * pre-processing (imputation, scaling, etc)
  * classificaiton (decision trees / logistic regression).

## Important files

`loan1.inpynb` can be read as a standalone report. If you have a modern browser, open this and read it. If you have an old browser, open the latest file in the folder with html-output.

`TODO` contain instructions on how to move this project forward.

## Folder structure

`html-output` is an export of the jupyter notebook.

`notes` contain useful ideas etc to myself.

## Status 

I paused this because my model did not score well. 
The code is pretty but it performs badly.
